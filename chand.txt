The unmanned lunar exploration
mission includes a lunar orbiter and an impactor. The spac
version of the PSLV XL on 22 October 2008 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh at
06:23 IST(00:52 UTC). The Vehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.
The Moon Impact Probe was successfully impacted at the lunar south pole at 20:31 hours on 14 November 2008.
The remote sensing satellite had a mass of 1380 kilograms at launch and 675 kilograms at lunar orbit
and carries high resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, and soft and hard X-ray frequencies.
Over a two-year period, it is intended to survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and
3-dimensional topography. The polar regions are of special interest, as they might contain ice.
